# Quad clustering coefficient in a hypergraph
The quad clustering coefficient, one of the generalisations of the clustering coefficient, is the fraction of quads around a node in a hypergraph.

This Fortran code implements the quad clustering coefficient in a hypergraph as presented in this paper.

## Disclaimer
The code has only been tested and compiled with Apple clang version 14.0.0 (GNU Fortran).
